*Note:* This is NOT live yet. Hold your horses. And tweets.

IAS-bingo was forked from [NICAR Bingo] and adapted for the [Information Architecture Summmit].

To play, tweet at [@iasBingo] and you will receive a bingo card with randomly generated squares and a link to the interactive version. 

Each bingo card square has a description (and accompanying hashtag) of something an attendee might encounter at the IA Summit.

To claim a square, take a photo and tweet it with the matching hashtag, mentioning [@iasBingo]. The bot will fill in the square with the photo and send you an updated bingo card. Fill out a complete row or column and, bingo, you win!

Meanwhile, the leaderboard will keep track of those closest to getting a Bingo, list the latest dozen square submissions and, of course, those who have already reached it.

# Getting started
(still unchanged from original repo)

*Note: [@NICARBingo] runs on an ubuntu server on digitalocean.com*

### Set up your server
Get the right libraries (You might need to apt-get some of these individually)
```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev git python-pip python-dev phantomjs
$ sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```
Access the mysql shell with your login (your username might be root) and set up a mysql server named after the bingo game you want

```sh
$ mysql -u USER -pPASSWORD
mysql> create database nicarbingo
```
### Twitter
- Create a Twitter account
- Create New App
- Generate the API Keys and Access Tokens (Make sure access level is Read, Write)

### HTML template
- Download this [repo]
- ```nicar-bingo/website/static/siteart/star.svg``` - SVG for the logo found here
- ```nicar-bingo/website/static/templates/card.html``` and ```leaderboard.html``` - The markup for player cards and leaderboard
- ```nicar-bingo/website/static/css/bingo.css``` - Where to adjust the style
- edit ```daemon.py``` in ``` nicar-bingo``` and change the website on **line 249** to the domain you want (Right now it's nicarbingo.com)

### Credentials
- Create a file called config.json and copy over the contents of config-sample.json
- Fill out config.json with the MySQL database details and the Twitter handleâ€™s API keys
- Note: mysql default host might be 127.0.0.1 depending on your settings

### Creating the squares
- Create a [spreadsheet] of goals following the included header format and export as a CSV
- Note: There must be at least 24 goals.
- Note: Only columns A and B must be filled in. The other columns are optional.
- Note: It is recommended that hashtags be no longer than 12 characters or they get cut off in the cards.
- Export the spreadsheet as a CSV file (```nameofcsv.csv```) and save it into the downloaded repo folder

### Setting up your mysql server
- Upload the repo with all your new files over to your server.
- cd into the nicar-bingo directory
- Import the bingo mysql schema: 
    - ```$ mysql -u USER -pPASSWORD nicarbingo < bingo.sql```
- Import the goals from the CSV to your mysql server:
    - ```$ python load_goals.py nameofcsv.csv```

### Bringing over Flask, Twitter bot files, etc
*Note: make sure you're in the nicar-bingo directory*
```sh
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv ve
$ . ve/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Wait, wait, wait. You need to adjust a python file-- uploading image data causes unicode problems. Sorry. **

Go to ```nicarbingo/ve/lib/python2.7/site-packages/twitter/api.py``` and comment out the second line: ```from future import unicode literals```

###Run those beautiful python files (for testing)
First tab
(*Note: make sure you're in the root/nicar-bingo directory*)
```sh
$ . ve/bin/activate
$ python daemon.py
```
Second tab
(*Note: make sure you're in the root/nicar-bingo directory*)
```sh
$ . ve/bin/activate
$ cd/website
$ python website.py
```
###Run those beautiful python files (forever)
```sh
$ . ve/bin/activate
$ nohup python daemon.py &
$ cd/website
$ nohup python website.py &
```
